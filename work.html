          <p>
            Through this project, I got an opportunity to learn about healthcare
            as well as the world of the design and the impact design has on the end
            user, and with this project infection prevention was the primary
            focus. Studies conducted by Cincinnati Children's Hospital show that
            infection prevention leads to less hospitalization which means lower
            cost for the individual. A task management device (with customized
            hardware) known as the 1-2-3 Device was developed in  previous years, this device was
            designed to help patients track their activities of daily living
            (bathing, exercise, and oral care) which serve to help prevent
            infections. With this project the team was task to redesign the
            1-2-3 Device (due to reliability issues due to problems with the
            hardware) into something more modern and impactful. I got to do user
            research and develop a web application that would be used to
            conduct testing to determine whether or not a mobile application
            with incentivization is needed to increase adherence to the activities
            of daily living and to see how a mobile application will complete
            with the plethora of applications that exist on mobile devices. The team and I conducted staff, parent, and patient interviews. The insights gained from those interviews were used to then determine what aspects (hardware, software, look and feel) of the device and infections prevention system needed to be improved.

            With this project I got an opportunity to lead a software development
            project, from finding a hosting platform to coding it up. I also got
            an opportunity to work on a team as a lead developer. I really
            learned the impotance of commenting and version control thorugh this
            project. The project still has many iterations to go before it will
            be deemed complete, but nonetheless feel free to check out the
            current version!
