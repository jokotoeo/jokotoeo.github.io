            further develop my technical skills while engaging my drive in order

            This knowledge I took a deep dive into how user centric designed
            helps to amplify the end solution that is being developed. I got an
            opportunity to learn a lot about design methodologies in both
            general design and software design.

            This opportunity allowed me to be engage with software in a position
            that I was not too familar with, testing and validation software. I
            learned about different methodologies to develope and test software
            symotaneously. Also gain a lot of valuable knowledge regarding the
            aviation industry.

            gain with others in the Freshman engineering course: Engineering
            Design and Thinking I & II. As a part of this course I had an
            opportunity to serve as a mentor to a group of 20 students and give
            them advice about how to survive the first year of engineering by
            giving them stress management, as well as academic and professional
            develpement tips.
